## **Overview**:
  It would be a fair expectation that a ride-share business's success varies based on the population density and level of urban development present in whichever location the business operates in. Based on this expectation, an analysis was conducted to test the validity of this theory and to measure the extent of the theory's accuracy or inaccuracy based on the data from locations in different states of urban development. By applying the tools available from Python and Pandas within the Jupyter Notebook application, it was possible to create a visual presentation of this analysis and to determine the results from a single image comparing the analyzed data values.
